    <h2>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h2>

    <p>
      <em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
        with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
    </p>

        legitimate business interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your
        personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in
        order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
        process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet
        national security or law enforcement requirements).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to
        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations

    <h2>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>
      <em>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
        this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than
      90 days.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>

  <section id="infosafe">
    <h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

    <p>
      <em>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
        technical security measures.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
      any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
      electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
      so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be
      able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
      do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at
      your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.

    <h2>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

    <p>
      <em>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
      also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact

  <section id="DNT">
    <h2>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
      or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      notice.

      year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
